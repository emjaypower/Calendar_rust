# Overview

This is a program that was made to demonstrate an understanding of the rust language and its syntax,
and an understanding of the use of variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, and functions with this language.
The program will prompt a user for a month. This number must be an integer between 1 and 12. It will then prompt for a year. The year must be an integer greater than 1753. It will then display the calendar of the specified month. A link to a short software demonstration video is provided.
